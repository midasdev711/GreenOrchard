This is a user's profile page, showing their picture, banks used,
last logged in, and a link to edit their profile. Refer to the drawing
with their name and picture, and the list of banks used. It also says
"Change username, change password, change email" on the right, but we
are using that in the edit profile page instead.

NOTE: This is mostly what we originally said was the "edit profile"
page, but this will actually be this page instead.
