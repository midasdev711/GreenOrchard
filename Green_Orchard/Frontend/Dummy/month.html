This is the individual month page where users can see all their
expenses for a specific month. Refer to the drawing with the pie chart,
quote, and a table of expenses.

NOTE 1: This is the page that the React project was based on
NOTE 2: The pie chart and quote will switch positions on page
NOTE 3: We are excluding Rent as a top expense (more on this later)
