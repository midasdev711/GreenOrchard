This is what the header will look like on most of the 
pages throughout the application. We don't have a specific drawing
for this (I do in my summary page notes, so I can provide more info).
What we need is below:

Header (in the form of one big nav bar)
- Left Side
  * The title "Green Orchard" with a tree image
  * The name of user, also link to profile page (if they are logged in)
  * Link to Login/Logout depending on their login/logout status

- Significant space around left and right side

- Right Side (if they are NOT logged in)
  * Link to the "About Us" page (call it something cool
    like "The Developers")
  * Link to FAQ's page
  * Link to Register page

- Right Side (if they ARE logged in)
  * Link to Summary page
  * List of last twelve months and archive (as a dropdown)
    - Have current month first, then other eleven in desc order
    - Archive link (for users who have more than a year)
  * Link to Categories page
  * List of "Other" as a dropdown
    - Link to Personal Budget page (disabled)
    - Link to Loan Tracker page (disabled)
    - Link to "About Us" page (call it something cool like
      "The Developers")
    - Link to FAQ page
