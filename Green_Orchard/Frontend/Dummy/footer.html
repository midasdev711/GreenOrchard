This is what the footer will look like on most of the
pages throughout the application. We don't have a specific drawing
for this (I do in my summary page notes, so I can provide more info).
What we need is below:

Footer:
- Copyright 2019 on the bottom left
- Our information, each in their own div
  * Include name
  * GitHub link as icon
  * LinkedIn link as icon
  * (Portfolio is optional if you want)
