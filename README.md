### Grow Your Orchard Today!

Green Orchard is a financial management application designed to give users a detailed overview of their recent expenditures. Simply create a profile and upload a CSV file from your bank of choice, and Green Orchard will read that data and create dynamic charts and tables providing monthly and overall breakdowns of your finances. Users' profiles are customizable and help keep their data and summaries organized, engaging, and easy to interpret.

## Technologies Used:
JavaScript, Django, Python, ReactJS, News API, D3.js, HTML5, CSS3

## How to Use:
Register for an account on the home page and you will be given an option to upload a CSV file from any bank for which you want to track expenses. Green Orchard will then use this file to automatically generate graphical summaries and tables that display the expenses within the file in an organized, easily interpretable fashion. Green Orchard features an FAQ section that answers common questions users may have; a link to this can be found in the site header.

## Future Improvements:
- Ability to drill down into the pie chart summarizing your expenses sorted by month (i.e. click on a listed category, and the chart will change to display all of the expenses that went into that category for a given month)
- Budget and Loan Tracker features that will increase Green Orchard's overall financial utility for users
- Improved mobile responsiveness so Green Orchard can become a full-fledged mobile application
